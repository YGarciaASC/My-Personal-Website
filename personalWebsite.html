            <h2>Hello</h2>
            <p class ="abtMe">I'm Yahir E. Garcia, a student at the Urban Assembly School of Design and Construction. I first got into coding through an attempt in creating a game on Roblox, using the Lua language. I really enjoyed seeing how lines of words and symbols could make a world that a person could interact with and have fun in. And I saw that the same concepts I learned could be used to create massive games. I applied to AllStar Code for my 2019 summer so that I could increase my knowledge of programming and fields of work that required those skills. </p>
